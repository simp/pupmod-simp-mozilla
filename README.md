## Overview

This module provides classes to install Mozilla Firefox and Mozilla Thunderbird.

## This is a SIMP module
This module is a component of the [System Integrity Management Platform](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/SIMP), a compliance-management framework built on Puppet.

If you find any issues, they can be submitted to our [JIRA](https://simp-project.atlassian.net/).

Please read our [Contribution Guide](https://simp-project.atlassian.net/wiki/display/SD/Contributing+to+SIMP) and visit our [developer wiki](https://simp-project.atlassian.net/wiki/display/SD/SIMP+Development+Home).

This module is optimally designed for use within a larger SIMP ecosystem, but it can be used independently:
* When included within the SIMP ecosystem, security compliance settings will be managed from the Puppet server.
* If used independently, all SIMP-managed security subsystems are disabled by default and must be explicitly opted into by administrators.  Please review the `client_nets` and `$enable_*` parameters in `manifests/init.pp` for details.


## Module Description

This module will only install Mozilla Firefox and Mozilla Thunderbird, depending on the class included.

## Setup

### What mozilla affects

The `firefox` and `thunderbird` packages.

### Beginning with mozilla

To install `firefox`:
```puppet
include 'mozilla::firefox'
```

To install `thunderbird`:
```puppet
include 'mozilla::thunderbird'
```

`init.pp` contains no code and including it will do nothing.

## Development

Please see the [SIMP Contribution Guidelines](https://simp-project.atlassian.net/wiki/display/SD/Contributing+to+SIMP).


### Acceptance tests

To run the system tests, you need [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) installed. Then, run:

```shell
bundle exec rake acceptance
```

Some environment variables may be useful:

```shell
BEAKER_debug=true
BEAKER_provision=no
BEAKER_destroy=no
BEAKER_use_fixtures_dir_for_modules=yes
```

* `BEAKER_debug`: show the commands being run on the STU and their output.
* `BEAKER_destroy=no`: prevent the machine destruction after the tests finish so you can inspect the state.
* `BEAKER_provision=no`: prevent the machine from being recreated. This can save a lot of time while you're writing the tests.
* `BEAKER_use_fixtures_dir_for_modules=yes`: cause all module dependencies to be loaded from the `spec/fixtures/modules` directory, based on the contents of `.fixtures.yml`.  The contents of this directory are usually populated by `bundle exec rake spec_prep`.  This can be used to run acceptance tests to run on isolated networks.
